Every city is unique in their own way and give something new. And now the information is so common regarding location of every place around the world on your fingertips which make it easier to explore. Therefore, tourists always eager to travel to different places on the basis of available information, and the comparison (the part of the information) between the two cities always assist to choose the specific places or according to their choice.\n",

    "For this problem, we will get the services of Foursquare API to explore the data of two cities, in terms of their neighborhoods. The data also include the information about the places around each neighborhood like restaurants, hotels, coffee shops, parks, theaters, art galleries, museums   and many more. We selected one Borough from each city to analyze their neighborhoods.  Manhattan from New York and Downtown Toronto from Toronto. We will use machine learning technique, “Clustering” to segment the neighborhoods with similar objects on the basis of each neighborhood data. These objects will be given priority on the basis of foot traffic (activity) in their respective neighborhoods. This will help to locate the tourist’s areas and hubs, and then we can judge the similarity or dissimilarity between two cities on that basis. "

It means the top venues are showing the foot traffic or the more visited places. \n",
