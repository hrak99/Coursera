    "A sort of sub-language within Python, Pandas has its own set of idioms. We've alluded to some of these already, such as using vectorization whenever possible, and not using iterative loops if you don't need to. Several developers and users within the Panda's community have used the term pandorable for these idioms. I think it's a great term. So, I wanted to share with you a couple of key features of how you can make your code pandorable."

We have seen that even though Pandas allows us to iterate over every row in a dataframe, it is geneally very slow to do so. Fortunately Pandas has a groupby() function to speed up such task. The idea behind the groupby() function is that it takes some dataframe, splits it into chunks based on some key values, applies computation on those chunks, then combines the results back together into another dataframe. In pandas this is refered to as the split-apply-combine pattern."

A pivot table is itself a DataFrame, where the rows represent one variable that you're interested in, the columns another, and the cell's some aggregate value. A pivot table also tends to includes marginal values as well, which are the sums for each column and row. This allows you to be able to see the relationship between two variables at just a glance."
