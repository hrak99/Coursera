    "### the Fourier transform decomposes a signal into the frequencies that make it up.\n",
    "### o imagine that you have a signal, let's take an example, we have a signal s1, right? And on the y axis here, you have the amplitude of the signal, on the x axis you have the time. \n",
    "### So if you want to measure the strength of the signal, let's say at some specific time, you take a point here. And you look at the distance between the 0 on the y axis and that's your strength, that's the amplitude of the signal. If you look the same for another signal s2, let me pick another color. We select the same moment in time and we measure this distance. So in this case, this distance is 2 whatever it means. I haven't defined the scale of my axis is just the amplitude of the signal. And then for the 1 on the top, the distance is 1.\n",
    "### Now what happens if you emit these two signals of the same time, So what happens if you get a signal s1 + s2 is for the same point in time, let me pick another color, at the same point in time. Your distance here will be the sum of these two distances. So because these two signals are being added together. So you have one from s1, which is here. And then you will have two from s2, which is here. So you end up with a total distance of three. So when you add signals together, you are just kind of summing these of waves.\n",
    "### Fourier transform does. It takes a complex signal and it decomposes it to the frequencies that made it up, so these two signals, right?\n",
    "### the piano is essentially a signal generator. Each key on the piano generates a unique sound wave, because when the hammer hits the strings based on the thickness of the strings and also the tension. This inpart generates air pressure which is essentially a sound wave. And each key on the piano has its unique frequency. So the range of the piano goes from about I think 27 hertz here in the low end, and it goes all the way up to about 4200 hertz here in the high end. So what I like to do now, is I would like to pick a core which consist of different notes. \n",
    "### So we have different frequencies mix together and see if we can actually recover the region of frequencies using Fourier transform.\n",
    "###  if I pick a chord maybe this one, [SOUND] so this chord is comprised of three individual notes. We have three different original signals. Let's say this is your signal 1, s1. This is s2, and this is s3. And these signals here on the chart don't reflect the frequencies of the piano notes. This is just for illustration, but the idea is that you have three different signals. Each one generated by a piano key, and when we merge them together you get something like this. That's the signal of s1 + s2 + s3 and on the, sorry, s2 + s3, and on the y axis here you have amplitude, on the x axis you have the time, right? And the duration of my clip are something like 4 seconds, so we have 4 seconds here.\n",
    "### What Fourier transform does, is it kind of moves us from the time domain to the frequency domain. So we will get a plot like this one where we have on the x axis different frequencies, right? And we said that the piano varies between something like 20 hertz and let's say I'm interested to look up to 4200 hertz.\n",
    "### And then on the y axis, we will get the strength of the signal. So in this case, you can see we have three distinct signals. This is the strength, the amplitude of the first one. That's the one, With the lowest frequency, so that's why it comes first in the chart. That's s2, this signal is the in the middle between these two, in terms of frequency. So it come second on the chart because the frequency increases in this direction. And then s3 comes in the height of the bars, shows the amplitude of the signal. \n",
    "### Fourier transform does, it helps us transition between the time and frequency domain. And actually, there is also the inverse Fourier transform which I'm not going to cover in this session, but just to let you know, it exist. So if you want to transition from the frequency to the time domain to something like this, what you need is IFT inverse Fourier transform."

    "### And the purposes of the first script is to plot the way file so that you see the combined signal. And then the second script will actually apply Fourier transform and decompose this signal to its original frequencies. So let me first run this script, which will plot our signal.\n",
    "### As you saw, the duration of the signal is about 4 seconds, so 4,000 milliseconds. You can see this on the x axis here, and then on the y axis, you have the amplitude of the signal, and the signal you can see slowly fades away because it gradually gets quieter. You can hear this in the recording.\n",
    "### Now, if I take the same file and I apply Fourier transform, my expectation is to get this plot, which we call the spectrogram, this is essentially the energy distribution of the signal over the frequency. So my expectation is, let me find the script, to get the spectrogram and see the individual frequencies of all the signals that make up this cord. \n",
    "### So if we now focus on the plot, you see here that we have different signals. It's not perfect, we won't see three perfect signals, three perfect bars for each individual key because this is an actual piano. And there are harmonics and there is also noise in the recording and so on and so on. But what I'm interested in is to focus on the top three signals in terms of strength.\n",
    "### So if I look at this plot, maybe I focus on all the signals over 750 or 800, whatever it means. \n",
    "###  will just trim this plot and look only at the signals above 800. So here I will put this restriction in my script, and because it's a bit difficult to accelerate the plot, I will also print the frequencies. Now, by the way, you can notice that all my signals are somewhere here between, I would say 20 Hertz and not above 4000 Hertz anyway. So this is the range of the piano, this is what I expect to see, right. So let's run the script with the filter and see what we end up with, right.\n",
    "### o now we have three signals, you can see them here. These are the most powerful signals in my recording. There are actually four, but the first two are super close together. The first one is something between 329, 330 hertz, so maybe 329.5, something like this, that are just kind of overlapping. The second one is 415 hertz, and the third one is 555 hertz.\n",
    "### When we compare with piano strings, frequency or specific word is matched for these 3 frequencies.\n",

    "### So if I go back here, right, in my case with the piano, I had three individual signals, having their own frequencies and amplitudes. And I merge them together, and then I decompose them using Fourier transform.\n",
    "### the signals were very simple because they all had the same frequency. The only difference was in the amplitudes. And also you will notice that all the signals here start at the same time. So, if you look at the second signal, s2, it starts zero zero. So there is one wave here, goes all the way down and back to the zero on the y axis. And this is the same case with s1. It starts at zero zero, and then you have one wave, goes back to zero. And the same with this guy here. The combined signal of course.\n",
    "### Now this is not always the case. First of all, signals can have different frequencies. So if I look at this more complex example, you see that the frequency of this signal here is not the same as the frequency of that signal. For the same period of time, if I said this is s2 and this is s1, for the same period of time in s1 I get, I don't know, n waves. Here in S2 I get something like 2 times n, right? I have more waves for the same period of time, because the second signal has higher frequency. That's what frequency is, the number of occurrences per unit of time.\n",
    "### if you look here, where the signal start, s2 starts at 0.0 and then you have the first wave. But S1 doesnâ€™t start at 0,0. If you continue this until it reaches the zero on the y axis you will see it starts at minus something, right? So at zero, I already have the maximum amplitude for the signal. And this is what we call phase shift. The signal is slightly shifted, it doesn't start at 0.0. So this is called phase shift, I'll write it down here, phase shift.\n",
    "### o if you want to describe a signal, you need three things. First, you need the frequency of the signal, which shows you how many occurances in the period you have. Second, you need the amplitude. You need to know how high the signal goes, what is the strength of the signal. And three, you need the phase shift, you need to know where the signal starts.\n",
    "### ou can get y as function of t, and this will be A times sine of 2pi f t + phi, right.\n",
    "### his one, which is a very simple function called gen_wave that accepts the frequency, the amplitude, the period, and the time shift. And there is another parameter, sampling rate. I will talk about sampling rate later. So what this function does is it just generates the values for x the time period and then it computes he signal by multiplying the amplitude, times, you can see it here, amplitude times the sine of two pi times the frequency, the time, and the phase shift.\n",
    "### And we can use this function to generate all kinds of signals if you want. And it's interesting to see, if I go back here, how we can use this function to generate complex signals. So if this is my signal S1, S2, and S3, I can actually use the same function to get S1 + S2 + S3. So let's do this.\n",
    "### So these are the two signals summed up together. Signal one is frequency of 1 over 10 seconds. Signal two is frequency of 2 over 10 seconds. And I can do something even more interesting, and yeah, as you can see also, the amplitude of the second signal is 2. So that's why we have this like almost two waves overlapping, because the amplitude of signal one is 1, the amplitude of signal two is 2. And I can add a third one here that has a frequency of 3. And then the amplitude is, I don't know, maybe set it to 4, see what happens. And we have to add it, right. So this is how we can generate complex signals. And of course if you now apply Fourier transform to this signal, you will, hopefully, get the original three signals that are being added together to construct this more complex signal, all right,\n",
    "### We had this complex signal, we kind of passed the signal through a Fourier transform and then the output was the spectrogram that allows us to recover the original frequencies. And we can then actually reconstruct the original signals if we want.\n",

    "### Now that we know how to sample signal, it's time to look at modification of the algorithm known as discrete Fourier transform.\n",
    "### So first the definition, well, it says that any sampled signal of length N can be represented uniquely by a finite series of sinusoids.\n",
    "### What is the difference? Well, in the standard Fourier transform, we used function of time x of t to generate a continuous signal. Now with the discrete case, we don't have this function, we have a data set.\n",
    "### A set of points which we get by sampling the continuous signal. So I will use lowercase x to denote this data set, I will enclose it here. And I will say that it contains, well, the readings from my sampling, x0 x1, and so on until let's say xN-1. So the length of my data set x = N. And what discrete Fourier transform will do for me is it will transform this data set of lowercase x into another data set of lets say upper case X, which contains the Fourier coefficients, right? So I will have things like X0, X1, And so on until XN-1. And each X here,\n",
    "### Now one question that you may ask is how come that these two data set have the same length, N-1? And that's an excellent question. If you think about it, what drives the length of this data set is the sampling grade, because over a period of time, the number of data points that I read is exactly the sampling grade, right? And then if you think about the other data set, we said that the frequency is the number of occurrences per unit of time. So if I am sampling with certain frequency, I can not recognize signals that have larger frequency than the sampling frequency, just because I don't get enough data points.\n",
    "### What will happen is, like the example I showed you, when I have too few data points, I lose the signal. It kind of turns into flat line. Because the resolution is low, the representation of the sampled signals doesn't actually follow the actual signals. So if I have signals with very high frequencies on a very low sampling grade, I won't be able to recognize these signals at all.\n",
    "### So the number of frequencies that I can recognize by applying the Fourirer transform is actually driven by the sampling rate as well.\n",
    "### I have a script that generates a signal. In this case I'm doing a frequency of 3 Hz, amplitude of 2, period of 1, sampling grade is 50, and then I also apply Fourier transform. And again, I'm treating it as a black box because that's discreet Fourier transform. We haven't talked about how to actually apply it. But let me run the script now and see what we get. So this is my signal, amplitude of two, and I have three waves over the time period. And here on my spectrogram, I have one bin with a height of two because it reflects the amplitude of the signal. And it's at position three, which is the frequency of the signal, right? Nothing new here. This is what we expect.\n",
    "### if I add more signals into the mix. So maybe I will generate second signal with a frequency of 5. Let's say same amplitude, same period, and I'll add this to the original signal. So now I have my signal with frequency of 3, amplitude of 2 added to signal with frequency of 5 and amplitude of 2. And I will plot this and apply Fourier transform.\n",
    "### So let's see what happens. Okay, so here you see that we have a more complex signal this time, but the transformation is correct here and it perfectly recognizes two distinct signals. One with frequency of three, the other one five, both having amplitude of two. If I add another one, let's say frequency of I don't know, frequency of maybe six, yeah. And let's leave the amplitude to one. See what happens. You have to add it to the signal, right? Again, we can now detect three signals. This one have the strength of the other two because its amplitude is one, right? So this is what you expect. \n",
    "### What do you think will happen if I change the frequency, let's say of my second signal from 6 to let's say 6.5. What do you think will happen?... Because we don't hear of a bin with the frequency of 6.5, this signal is being decomposed to some further signals. And when you add them together, you get this signal of frequency 6.5. Okay, this was a tricky question. But my point is about something grade and the number of bins, the resolution of the spectrogram. So if I remove these additional signals, if I go to back to my original signal thatâ€™s only one simple sinusoid, amplitude of two, frequency of three. Here you can see that I have a number of bins in my spectrogram. This is driven by my sampling grade because this tells me how many different frequencies I can recognize My sampling grade is 50 here.\n",
    "### I don't see 50 bins because there is something else called the Nyquist limit, and it has to do with the spectrogram being actually symmetrical. So, okay, I wasn't planning to do this in this session, but maybe I'll just show you the full spectrogram. So, right. So this is the full spectrogram from the Fourier transform, all right? And there is a specific point somewhere in the middle of the spectrogram called the Nyquist limit or Nyquist point. And the spectrogram is symmetrical around this point. It's almost like a mirror\n",
    "### So the left hand side of the spectrogram contains all the information that we need, so normally we just don't plot this right-hand side. But the point is I have a sampling grade of 50, and I actually have 50 bins here in the full spectrogram. However, it's symmetrical and all the information I need Is contained in the first 25, so I just kind of don't plot the others\n",
    "### I will get a number of bins with different amplitudes that I have to sum up to actually approximate the original signal. And probably the original signal won't actually represent the actual signal. So the sampled version won't actually represent the original version because of the lower resolution... less bins, less sampling rate\n",
    "### Euler formula used to negotiate with complex number i, as it is not recgnised , Because it's not supported in NLLib, it's not supported in SystemML, so we have to find a way around it.\n",
    "### o if I compute these two sums, I don't actually have to deal with the complex numbers. And this is how I can get this pair of coefficients for XK, right? And this what this grade Fourier transform looks like. Now we need to think about implementing it. And because I said that it doesn't come out of the box in MA lib, what I will do is how we used system ML, and how we write an implementation from scratch.\n"

It doesn't have to be an audio signal, it can be a sensory signal, it can be anything. You can decompose it to signals, get this almost like a fingerprint of the frequencies and their magnitudes.\n",

If I go do something else, come back to the signal in one hour, take another look, so in another moment in time the signal looks exactly the same. If I look at the signal in one day or one week or after one year, it looks exactly the same, the signal never changes. Another way to put this is to say that the signal contains all its frequencies always.\n",

And then something again completely different. And the problem is that Fourier transform doesn't work very well in this type of situations. \n",

This could be some kind of a sensor reading, this could be some kind of an anomaly. We want to be able to detect those things and to handle them in a more intelligent way.\n",
    "### f we have a very simple signal generated by a stationary process. You see here I have frequency of 1 amplitude of 3 over a period of 10. The phase shift is zero, and that's a very simple, very basic signal, this guy here. And then I apply Fourier transform, and that's what I see. Exactly what I expect to see here over this period. I have ten repetitions of the signal, so you know frequency of ten. And I can apply the inverse Fourier transform and reconstruct the signal.\n",

At time T2 I have this burst in the signal, right? And if I try to apply Fourier transform I get something like this.\n",
    "### Okay, I still have my main frequency in the signal. I can identify it, it's the dominant frequency. But then this short burst kind of factorizes into all these small frequencies here. Which if I add them back together, if I applied the inverse Fourier transform, I will get the same thing. I will reconstruct the signal. \n",
    "### ut if I look at this image down here in the second part of the plot, if I look here only, I have no idea what happens in the signal. What frequencies, I see the frequencies in the signal but I can't identify that this was actually a short burst in the signal. If I look at the top of the plot, if I look here, right? I can identify the burst, it's here, but I have no idea at what specific point, what frequencies are part of the signal in this specific moment in time. So, I am kind of confined either to the time domain or to the frequency domain, but I never get the complete picture. That's the problem with signal-generated by non-stationary process."

    "### So, if I applied continuous wavelength transform to this signal, I will get a bunch of coefficients. And the best way to give you the intuition is to plot this coefficients on something called a scalogram. I need to plot that looks like this, and I'll try to explain it to you. It's kind of a heat map, right? But you will notice first that here we have a time component.\n",

And if you go back to this signal, you will notice that it starts at 0, goes up to 10, and it's pretty much the same on the scalogram. It starts at 0 goes up to 1000 because of the sampling rate of 100. It shows this plot covers the entire signal. The coefficients of the transform cover the entire signal.\n",

If it helps, you can think about the scale as a scale on a map, right? So if I use these screenshots from Google Maps, for example, this is a scale of 20 meters, right? And it shows you, for example, this is the IBM office\n",

And you can see that in the higher scale region, we have this continuous wave that goes through time. And it's always here. And then in the lower scales where we have high frequencies, we have this sharp berth, here. If we rotate this way, you will see them better, right. Okay, so these are our bursts and here we have the discomponent that goes through the entire signal that's always there. \n",
    "### Or you can take a look from this perspective and that's the time, right? And you see something very similar to actually the time domain, right? You have this constant components on the background and then you have the sharp burst at the foreground. And these are the same coefficients that I used for the scalogram.

Don't think about this, this is just used for energy normalization so that we have the same energies across all the scales.\n",

So, this is your signal as a function of time, and psi here, this guy, is what we call a mother wavelet.\n",

Various different small waves like for example, the Haar-wavelet, or the Gaussian wavelet, and this is what they look like. This function psi will give you something like this. And based on the coefficients that you pass to the function, you can control the shape of this wavelet. \n",

And this wavelet kind of projects here on my signal, right? And I can treat this small wave as a sliding window, right. I can just start moving this wavelet over my signal.

Our scales are not continuous, we just changed the scale by a very small amount at each iteration and so on. But again, then we end up with a whole bunch of coefficients.

We have 25,000 points in the signal data points. So we have to multiply 25,000 by 100 to get the number of coefficients. And that's just the first plot, right? And we have two of them because we have two audio clips. So this will take a while but it will give you really nice view of how these two signals differ. So let's give it a time. It's ready.\n",
    "### So on the left hand side we have our AC. And you can see these spikes here in the the high frequency area of the plot. And on the right hand side you'll see this drill which is all over the place with this spike here. Where is this? Close to 25,000 if we go back to the signal."
